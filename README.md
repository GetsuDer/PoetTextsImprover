# Hamlet. Sorting strings and more.

## Description
Because alphabetical order is always better, we should help poets to sort their poems in different ways.

## Starting
Only for Linux yet. Only for english strings.
Run 'make all' and then './improver input_file output_file1 output_file2 output_file3', where in 'output_file1'
will be written input_file sorted by strings beginnings, in 'output_file2' - on ends, and in 'output_file3' -
the original order of strings.

##Testing
Run 'make test'. If you want to add your own tests, put them into 'Testing' folder in next format:
'testname.test' and 'testname.test.out1', 'testname.test.out2', 'testname.test.out3'.
